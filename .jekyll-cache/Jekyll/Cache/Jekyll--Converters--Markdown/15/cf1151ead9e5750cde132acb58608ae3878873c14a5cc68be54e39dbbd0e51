I"‡<p>I must admit, I found myself to be a bit short for words here. For the past couple of weeks I haven‚Äôt spent much time looking into some of the things that I had been planning to look into to prepare me for CIT480. Those things would have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terraform</li>
  <li>Ansible</li>
  <li>Playing around with my newly acquired AWS Education credits</li>
  <li>Building on my knowledge of Docker</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, most of my time has gone towards planning out my group‚Äôs project for CIT496P. Since Professor Kaplan has decided to revamp the course into a DevOps practicum, we‚Äôve actually seen a massive influx of CompSci students (eww) take the course to fill in the ‚ÄúDev‚Äù roles on each team. Despite being a CIT major, I‚Äôve actually taken in interest taking one of the ‚ÄúDev‚Äù roles in the team, mainly due to my working (and still improving) knowledge of full stack development.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-the-application-do">What will the application do?</h3>

<p>The application is a QR Attendance system meant to be used by CSUN students to log into their respective courses. Students will be required to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log into their CSUN accounts on their phones (using our mobile app)</li>
  <li>Log on to the attendance site (also built by us), and choose the course they are attending</li>
  <li>If the student wishes to check in, they will be prompted with a QR code, which they will scan with their phone application</li>
  <li>If the student can not attend class, there will be an option for the student to request an absence excuse</li>
  <li>Instructors will also be able to log in to the site to view their course attendance records, course rosters, and attendance excuse submissions from students.</li>
</ol>
