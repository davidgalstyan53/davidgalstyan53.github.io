I"å<p>I must admit, I found myself to be a bit short for words here. For the past couple of weeks I havenâ€™t spent much time looking into some of the things that I had been planning to look into to prepare me for CIT480. Those things would have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terraform</li>
  <li>Ansible</li>
  <li>Playing around with my newly acquired AWS Education credits</li>
  <li>Building on my knowledge of Docker</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, most of my time has gone towards planning out my groupâ€™s project for CIT496P. Since Professor Kaplan has decided to revamp the course into a DevOps practicum, weâ€™ve actually seen a massive influx of CompSci students (eww) take the course to fill in the â€œDevâ€ roles on each team. Despite being a CIT major, Iâ€™ve actually taken in interest taking one of the â€œDevâ€ roles in the team, mainly due to my working (and still improving) knowledge of full stack development.</p>
