title: "Blog 1: An Update for the QR App (somewhat)"
---

(**NOTE**: See my [previous post](https://davidgalstyan53.github.io/2020/09/04/Blog0-QR-Scanner-Application.html) for background)

The layout of the QR code application has been drawn out, and our first sprint is underway. The sprint will be due to finish on the 23rd of September, so this will give me plenty of time to implement and debug some of the PHP files. This is a rough draft of what the site (not the application) will cover:

As I stated in the previous blog entry, I will be using my COMP484 final project as a reference guide for the user login system. You will find the repo at my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/davidgalstyan53).
