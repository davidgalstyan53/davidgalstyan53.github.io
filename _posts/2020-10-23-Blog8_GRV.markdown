title: "Blog 8: CLI Tool for Exploring Github Repos"
---

Admittedly, this blog post won't be super technical. However, we're just over midway past the semester, and my brain is hurting, so the next Snort post will have to wait.

I did, however, find a new tool that I will be using to explore github repos. The tool is called GRV, or Git Repository Viewer. This will essentially give us an awesome CLI tool to explore Github with, but gives us a more usable interface to work with (at least for those who are uncomfortable with CLI). To give you an idea, you will end up with something like this:

Here are a couple of prerequisites for installing GRV (I will be doing this on my Mac):
1. You will need Homebrew installed
2. You will also need Go installed
3. Afterward, enter the following command to install readline and cmake with Homebrew:

		$ brew install readline pkg-config cmake

If you are using a Linux distro, the same rules apply. You can use other methods, but this would be easiest.

In order to get started, navigate to the local directory for your desired pulled github repo. For the purposes of testing, mine would be "/Users/david/go/src/github.com/davidgalstyan53/davidgalstyan53.github.io"

Once inside the directory of our desired repo, enter the following command:
		
		$ grv
		
GRV by default will look in the current directory for a github repo. You can also enter the path to your repo as an argument. If I were to do that in this case, it would be:

		$ grv /Users/david/go/src/github.com/davidgalstyan53/davidgalstyan53.github.io
		
The cool thing about GRV is that it uses VIM keybindings, so VIM users should feel right at home (yes, I said non CLI-ppl would like this as well...sue me). I'm still playing around with it, but it seems like this is a nifty little tool to use. I HATE using Github via CLI, but funny enough, I prefer using CLI for most other tasks. I feel like this program is a nice middle-ground. Try it out for yourself!
